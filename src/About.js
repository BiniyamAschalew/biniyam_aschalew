            I am an undergraduate student at KAIST, majoring in Computer Science
            with a minor in Industrial and Systems Engineering. My academic
            journey has been enriched by diverse research experiences, including
            work in areas like domain adaptation, multimodal language models,
            and graph machine learning. Iâ€™ve had the privilege of contributing
            to collaborative projects that have led to published work and
            practical applications. With a genuine curiosity for technology and
            its potential, I approach every challenge as an opportunity to
            learn, grow, and make a meaningful impact.
